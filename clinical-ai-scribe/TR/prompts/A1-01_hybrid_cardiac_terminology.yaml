    - Medical terminology processing (Turkish/English hybrid)
    - Cultural communication pattern recognition
    - Multi-speaker dialogue management
    - Indirect communication interpretation
    - Clinical priority assessment
    
    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Never provide medical advice or assume physician role
    - Preserve patient autonomy in multi-speaker scenarios
    - Maintain clinical accuracy while respecting cultural context
    - Flag urgent medical situations appropriately
    - Standardize hybrid medical terminology consistently
    
    TURKISH-SPECIFIC PROCESSING:
    - Recognize formal/informal language transitions
    - Identify family hierarchy and decision-making dynamics
    - Categorize religious/cultural references appropriately
    - Resolve ambiguous pronouns and temporal markers
    - Translate indirect symptom descriptions to clinical language

    # Participants: Emergency Physician, Patient (55M), Patient's Wife
    
    DOKTOR: "Merhaba Mehmet Bey, acil servise neden geldiniz?"
    
    HASTA: "Doktor bey, göğsümde çok kötü bir ağrı var. Sanki kamyon geçiyor üzerimden."
    
    EŞ: "2 saat önce başladı doktor. Evde çok kötü oldu, ambulans çağırdık."
    
    DOKTOR: "Ağrı nasıl bir ağrı? Crushing pain mi, yoksa sharp mı?"
    
    HASTA: "Crushing, çok ağır. Nefes alamıyorum. Heart attack mı geçiriyorum?"
    
    DOKTOR: "EKG çekiyoruz hemen. Daha önce kardiyak probleminiz var mıydı?"
    
    EŞ: "Bypass ameliyatı oldu 3 yıl önce. LAD'da stenoz vardı."
    
    HASTA: "Evet, triple bypass yaptırdım. Aspirin ve Plavix alıyorum."
    
    DOKTOR: "Şu anda aldığınız ilaçlar neler?"
    
    HASTA: "Aspirin 100mg, clopidogrel 75mg, atorvastatin 40mg günlük."
    
    HEMŞIRE: "EKG'de ST elevation var doktor, V2-V6 derivasyonlarda."
    
    DOKTOR: "Anterior STEMI. Kardiyoloji konsültasyonu istiyorum, cath lab'i hazırlayın."
    
    EŞ: "Çok kötü mü doktor? Allah korusun."
    
    DOKTOR: "Ciddi bir myokard infarktüsü. Hemen müdahale edeceğiz, merak etmeyin."
    
    HASTA: "İnşallah bir şey olmaz. Çocuklarım henüz küçük."
    
    DOKTOR: "En iyi şekilde tedavi edeceğiz. Troponin ve kreatinin de bakıyoruz."

  Severe chest pain with crushing quality, 2-hour duration, accompanied by dyspnea
  
  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  55-year-old male presents with acute onset severe chest pain described as "crushing, like a truck passing over chest" starting 2 hours prior to arrival. Pain associated with dyspnea. Patient concerned about possible myocardial infarction. Wife confirms timeline and severity requiring ambulance transport.
  
  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  - Triple vessel coronary artery bypass graft 3 years ago (LAD stenosis)

  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Patient in distress due to chest pain
  
  DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
  - ECG: ST elevations in V2-V6 leads consistent with anterior STEMI
  - Laboratory: Troponin and creatinine pending

  Anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
  - Cardiology consultation obtained
