# Prompt Evaluation Library for Clinical AI Scribes

A curated set of stress-test scenarios and evaluator prompts for **clinical note–generation LLMs**.  
Each case follows the Data–Assessment–Plan (DAP) note structure and is tagged for easy regression testing (e.g. `medication_logic`, `risk_communication`, `red_flag`).

## Contents
- **/Prompt-Evaluation Library for Clinical AI Scribes.pdf** – original white-paper (10 pp.)  
- `test_cases/` – JSON templates ready for LangChain/LangSmith  
- `README.md` – this guide

## Quick start
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Load a test case into your LangSmith suite.
3. Inspect the structured evaluator output ≈  
   `{ "format_match": true, "hallucination": false, … }`

## Why this matters
LLM-generated notes can hallucinate or omit critical facts; a reproducible test bench helps spot those errors before they reach patients.

persona: "You are an AI medical scribe tasked with summarizing patient visits accurately and completely."

instructions: |
  Focus on summarization fidelity. Do not provide medical advice or assume the role of a doctor.
  Accurately transcribe and summarize the patient visit, ensuring all relevant details are captured.
  When multiple patients are present, clearly distinguish between them and their individual information.

scenario:
  transcript: |
    DOC: Your twins are here for murmur follow-up. Let me check both of your charts. Twin A, how have you been feeling since our last visit?
    
    TWINS overlap talking: "I'm okay" / "I still get dizzy when I run" / "My chest doesn't hurt anymore" / "I get short of breath sometimes"
    
    DOC: Hold on, let me speak with each of you separately. Twin A, step over here first.
    
    TWIN A: I've been feeling fine. No chest pain, no dizziness. I can run and play sports without any problems.
    
    DOC: And Twin B, how about you?
    
    TWIN B: I still get dizzy when I run fast, and sometimes I feel short of breath. It's not as bad as before, but it's still there.
    
    DOC: Let me examine you both. *examines Twin A* Heart sounds normal, no murmur detected. *examines Twin B* I can still hear a faint murmur. Let me page the nurse for vitals.
    
    DOC pages nurse, returns after 10 minutes.
    
    NURSE: Twin A - BP 110/70, HR 72, normal. Twin B - BP 105/65, HR 68, normal.
    
    DOC: Based on the examination, Twin A's murmur has resolved. Twin B, I'd like to schedule a follow-up echocardiogram to monitor your condition.

  - history_of_present_illness
  - physical_examination
  - assessment_and_plan
  - patient_specific_details

key_checks:
  - "Both twins described separately with distinct symptoms and findings"
  - "No mixed-up vitals between Twin A and Twin B"
  - "Plan lists follow-up echo for Twin B only, not Twin A"
  - "Clear differentiation between resolved murmur (Twin A) and persistent murmur (Twin B)"
  - "Accurate transcription of overlapping dialogue without confusion"

evaluation_criteria:
  format_match: "Output follows standard clinical note format"
  accuracy: "All patient-specific details correctly attributed"
  completeness: "No omission of critical information for either patient"
  clarity: "Clear distinction between twin patients maintained throughout"
  hallucination: "No fabricated information added to the summary"
