    DOC: "Wait, Lipitor and atorvastatin are the same medication."
    PATIENT: "Really? I thought they were different. I've been taking both."
    DOC: "How long have you been taking both?"
    PATIENT: "About six months. My previous doctor started the atorvastatin and I kept taking the Lipitor."

    DOC: "Yes, stop the Lipitor. That's the brand name for atorvastatin."
