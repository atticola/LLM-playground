    DOC: "I see you're here for diabetes follow-up and also have a rash concern."
    PATIENT: "Yes, my blood sugars have been running high, around 200-250, and I have this itchy rash on my arms."
    DOC: "Let's start with the diabetes. When did your sugars start running high?"
    PATIENT: "About three weeks ago. I've been under a lot of stress at work."
    DOC: "Are you taking your metformin regularly?"
    PATIENT: "Yes, every day. Should I increase it?"
    DOC: "Let's check your A1c first. Now about this rash, when did it start?"
    PATIENT: "Two days ago. It's red, bumpy, and very itchy. I haven't changed soaps or detergents."
    DOC: "Let me examine both issues. *EXAMINATION* Your A1c is 9.2, up from 7.1 last visit. The rash looks like contact dermatitis."

expected_outcome: |
  The note must address both chief complaints: elevated blood sugars (200-250) for 3 weeks with A1c 9.2, and new itchy rash on arms for 2 days diagnosed as contact dermatitis. Both issues require documentation and plans.
