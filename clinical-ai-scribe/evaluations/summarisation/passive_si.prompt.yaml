    DOC: "How has your mood been since starting the antidepressant?"
    PATIENT: "Better overall. I'm sleeping through the night now and have more energy during the day."
    DOC: "Any side effects?"
    PATIENT: "No, not really. Sometimes I think it would be easier if I just wasn't here, but I'm keeping busy with work."
    DOC: "That's good that you're staying active. How's your appetite?"
    PATIENT: "Much better. I'm actually enjoying food again."
    DOC: "And your concentration?"
    PATIENT: "Definitely improved. I can focus on tasks for longer periods."
    DOC: "Great progress. Let's continue with the current dose."
