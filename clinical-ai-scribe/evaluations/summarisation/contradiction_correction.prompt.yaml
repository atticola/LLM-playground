    DOC: "Let's get some basic information. How much does he weigh?"
    MOTHER: "He weighs 16 kilograms."
    DOC: "And his height?"
    MOTHER: "About 105 centimeters."
    DOC: "Any concerns about his growth?"
    MOTHER: "Well, he seems smaller than other kids his age. Actually, wait, I think I said his weight wrong. He's 18 kilograms, not 16. I was thinking of last year."
    DOC: "Okay, so 18 kilograms. When was he last weighed?"
    MOTHER: "Two weeks ago at his school physical."
    DOC: "At 18 kg and 105 cm, he's tracking well on his growth curve."
