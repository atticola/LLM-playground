    DOC: "You're here for your annual physical. How have you been feeling?"
    PATIENT: "Pretty good overall. No major complaints."
    DOC: "Any new symptoms since last year?"
    PATIENT: "No, nothing significant. Oh, I had a CT scan for kidney stones last month and they found something on my liver, but the ER doctor said it was probably nothing."
    DOC: "What exactly did they find?"
    PATIENT: "I think they called it a lesion? 2 centimeters or something like that."
    DOC: "Do you have the report?"
    PATIENT: "No, I didn't think it was important."
    DOC: "We should follow up on that. I'll order an MRI and refer you to gastroenterology."
    PATIENT: "Is it serious?"
    DOC: "We need to evaluate it properly."
