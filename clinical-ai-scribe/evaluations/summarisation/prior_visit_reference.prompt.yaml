    DOC: "How have you been since your last visit?"
    PATIENT: "The chest pain is much better since we increased the metoprolol."
    DOC: "Good. As noted last month, your echo showed mild left ventricular dysfunction."
    PATIENT: "Right, and you said we'd recheck it in six months."
    DOC: "Yes, and your exercise tolerance?"
    PATIENT: "Better. I can walk two blocks now without getting short of breath."
    DOC: "That's improvement from last month when you could only walk half a block."
    PATIENT: "Yes, the medication is definitely helping."
    DOC: "Let's continue the current regimen and recheck your echo in May."
