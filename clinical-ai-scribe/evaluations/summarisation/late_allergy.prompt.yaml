    DOC: "You're here for your sinus infection. How long have you had these symptoms?"
    PATIENT: "About a week now. Thick yellow discharge, facial pressure, headache."
    DOC: "Any fever?"
    PATIENT: "Yes, up to 101.5 yesterday."
    DOC: "Let me examine you. *EXAMINATION* Yes, I can see inflammation. This looks like bacterial sinusitis."
    DOC: "I'm going to prescribe amoxicillin 500mg three times daily for 10 days."
    PATIENT: "Sounds good, thank you."
    DOC: "Any questions? *STARTS WRITING PRESCRIPTION*"
    PATIENT: "Oh wait, I just remembered - I'm allergic to penicillin. It gives me hives."
    DOC: "Oh! Good thing you remembered. Let me prescribe azithromycin instead."

  The note must capture the sinusitis diagnosis, the initial plan for amoxicillin, the late-discovered penicillin allergy, and the changed prescription to azithromycin. The allergy must be prominently documented despite being mentioned at the end.
