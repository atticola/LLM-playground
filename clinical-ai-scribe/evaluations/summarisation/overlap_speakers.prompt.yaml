    PATIENT: "I've been having chest pain for two hours."
    RESIDENT: "Tell me about the pain—"
    NURSE: "Blood pressure is 180 over 110, heart rate—"
    RESIDENT: "—is it crushing or sharp?"
    NURSE: "—102, oxygen sat 94% on room air."
    PATIENT: "It's like a tight band around my chest."
    RESIDENT: "Any shortness of breath?"
    NURSE: "EKG shows ST elevations in leads II, III, aVF."
    PATIENT: "Yes, I can't catch my breath."
    RESIDENT: "We need to activate the cath lab—"
    NURSE: "Troponin is 12.8, that's elevated."
    RESIDENT: "—this looks like an inferior STEMI."
