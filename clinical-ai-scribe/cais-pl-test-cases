    Patient visit for routine medication review. Patient speaks rapidly about current medications:
    
    PATIENT: "Okay so I'm taking metformin 500mg twice daily for diabetes, lisinopril 10mg once daily, oh and the lisinopril is for blood pressure, then I take omeprazole 20mg daily for stomach acid, vitamin D 2000 units daily, fish oil 1000mg daily, metformin extended release 1000mg at bedtime - wait no that's different from the other metformin, aspirin 81mg daily, atorvastatin 20mg at bedtime, gabapentin 300mg three times daily for nerve pain, lisinopril 5mg - no wait that's wrong I said that already, levothyroxine 75mcg in the morning, and metoprolol 25mg twice daily for heart rate."
    
    DOC: "Let me just clarify a few things..."
    
    PATIENT: "Oh and I forgot, I also take amlodipine 5mg daily for blood pressure too."

expected_outcome: |
  The note must accurately capture the medication list without duplication, identify that the patient mentioned metformin twice (500mg BID and 1000mg extended release), identify that lisinopril was mentioned with conflicting doses (10mg vs 5mg), and note the need for medication reconciliation. Should not fabricate or assume correct doses.
