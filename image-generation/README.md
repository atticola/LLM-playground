# Image Generation with LLMs & AI

This section of the repository tracks all aspects of AI image generation using Large Language Models and related technologies. It serves as a centralized knowledge base and project documentation hub for experimenting with and creating visual content.

## Directory Structure

- [`/projects/`](./projects/) - Individual image generation project documentation
- [`/tools/`](./tools/) - Guides for specific image generation tools
- [`/prompts/`](./prompts/) - Effective prompts for different visual generation tasks
- [`/workflows/`](./workflows/) - End-to-end workflows for different types of visual content
- [`/resources/`](./resources/) - Learning materials, tutorials, and reference guides

## Getting Started

1. For a complete overview of AI image generation fundamentals, read [image_generation_fundamentals.md](./image_generation_fundamentals.md)
2. Explore the [tools directory](./tools/) to learn about different image generation platforms
3. Check out [example projects](./projects/) to see complete documentation examples
4. Review [prompt techniques](./prompts/) to improve your image generation results
5. Study [workflows](./workflows/) for end-to-end production processes

## Purpose of This Section

This image generation section helps you:

1. **Document visual projects**: Keep detailed records of image generation experiments
2. **Track your progress**: See how your skills and outputs improve over time
3. **Build a prompt library**: Save effective prompts for creating different visual styles
4. **Standardize workflows**: Develop repeatable processes for consistent results
5. **Compare tools**: Evaluate different platforms for specific visual generation tasks
6. **Share knowledge**: Create a reference for yourself and collaborators
