## Major Image Generation Approaches

### Diffusion Models: How They Work

#### Core Process
1. **Forward Diffusion**: Gradually add noise to training images
2. **Reverse Diffusion**: Learn to remove noise step by step
3. **Conditioning**: Guide denoising based on text, images, or other inputs
4. **Sampling**: Generate new images by starting with noise and denoising

#### Key Components
- **U-Net Architecture**: Core network for noise prediction
- **Text Encoder**: Processes text prompts (e.g., CLIP)
- **Noise Scheduler**: Controls noise addition/removal rates
- **Sampling Methods**: Techniques like DDIM, ancestral sampling for generation

#### Popular Implementations
- **Latent Diffusion**: Works in compressed latent space (e.g., Stable Diffusion)
- **Pixel-Space Diffusion**: Works directly with pixels (e.g., DALL-E 2)
- **Guided Diffusion**: Uses additional signals for control (e.g., ControlNet)

### GANs: Creative Adversaries

#### Core Process
1. **Generator**: Creates images from random noise
2. **Discriminator**: Evaluates generator output against real images
3. **Adversarial Training**: Networks compete and improve each other
4. **Convergence**: Generator learns to create increasingly realistic images

#### Key Advances
- **StyleGAN**: Control over different aspects of generation (style, content, etc.)
- **BigGAN**: High-resolution, diverse image generation
- **CycleGAN**: Unpaired image-to-image translation

#### Current Status
- Less dominant than diffusion models for general-purpose text-to-image
- Still relevant for specialized tasks, particularly style transfer
- Often faster than diffusion models but can be less diverse

### Transformers in Image Generation

#### Vision-Language Models
- Encode both text and images in shared representation space
- Enable strong semantic understanding of prompts
- Examples: CLIP, ALIGN, CoCa

#### Transformer-Based Generation
- Use attention mechanisms to coordinate image elements
- Handle long-range dependencies in images
- Examples: Parti, DALL-E

#### Hybrid Approaches
- Combine transformer understanding with diffusion generation
- Best of both worlds: semantic richness and visual quality
- Examples: DALL-E 3 (GPT-4 + diffusion), Imagen

```

#### Core Elements
- **Subject**: Main focus of the image (person, object, scene)
- **Style**: Visual aesthetic (photorealistic, anime, oil painting)
- **Attributes**: Characteristics of subject (red hair, rusty, ancient)
- **Environment**: Setting or background (forest, urban street, underwater)
- **Lighting**: Light quality and direction (sunset lighting, dramatic shadows)
- **Composition**: Framing and arrangement (close-up, bird's eye view)
- **Technical Specifications**: Parameters like camera type, lens, film stock

#### Common Modifiers
- **Quality boosters**: high quality, detailed, professional, 8K
- **Style references**: in the style of [artist], [art movement], [era]
- **Mood setters**: moody, cheerful, somber, mysterious
- **Lighting descriptors**: golden hour, studio lighting, backlit

### Model-Specific Prompt Approaches

#### DALL-E 3
- Works well with conversational, detailed prompts
- Responds to multi-paragraph descriptions
- Benefits from specific artists or style references
- Example: `A serene Japanese garden with a small wooden bridge crossing a koi pond. Cherry blossoms fall gently onto the water's surface. Captured in the style of a Studio Ghibli animation with soft watercolor textures. Early morning light with mist rising from the water.`

#### Midjourney
- Uses special parameters after prompts (--stylize, --aspect, --version)
- Benefits from comma-separated lists of attributes
- Weight terms with :: notation
- Example: `Cyberpunk street market, neon signs, rainy night, steam rising from food stalls, detailed, cinematic lighting, 85mm lens --ar 16:9 --stylize 750`

#### Stable Diffusion
- Accepts both simple and complex prompts
- Benefits from weights in parentheses (term:1.2)
- Can reference model-specific terms
- Example: `A majestic snow-capped mountain (reflective lake:1.3) in the foreground, golden alpenglow, (detailed:1.2), atmospheric perspective, (volumetric light:0.8), Ansel Adams style, 8K`

### Prompt Techniques and Strategies

#### Weighted Terms
- Emphasize important elements by assigning weights
- Syntax varies by platform:
  - Midjourney: `term::weight`
  - Stable Diffusion: `(term:weight)`
- Example: `Portrait of a wizard (glowing magical aura:1.4) (intricate details:1.2) (dark background:0.8)`

#### Negative Prompting
- Specify what you don't want in the image
- Helps avoid common problems
- Examples:
  - DALL-E: "Avoid blurry details and distorted hands."
  - Stable Diffusion: Negative prompt: "blurry, distorted, low quality, grainy"

#### Style Reference
- Reference specific artists, media, or art movements
- Creates consistent stylistic approach
- Example: `in the style of Hayao Miyazaki, watercolor illustration, Studio Ghibli`

#### Technical Specifications
- Add photography or art medium terms
- Reference specific cameras, lenses, or techniques
- Example: `shot on Hasselblad, 90mm lens, shallow depth of field, Kodak Portra 400`

#### Composition Direction
- Specify framing, angle, and composition
- Use photography and cinematography terms
- Example: `overhead view, symmetrical composition, extreme close-up`
