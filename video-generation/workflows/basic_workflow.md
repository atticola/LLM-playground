## 1. Concept Development

### A. Define Your Goal

Start by clearly defining what you want to achieve:

- **Purpose:** What is this video for? (Social media, concept visualization, art project)
- **Length:** How long does it need to be? (Most tools generate 2-4 seconds, plan accordingly)
- **Style:** What visual style are you aiming for?
- **Content:** What should appear in the video?
- **Audience:** Who will watch this video?

### B. Create a Simple Storyboard

Even a rough storyboard helps visualize your concept:

- Sketch basic frames showing key moments
- Note camera movements and transitions
- Consider the narrative flow (beginning, middle, end)
- Plan how separate clips might be combined later

### C. Technical Planning

Determine technical specifications based on your needs:

- **Resolution:** Target resolution (480p, 720p, 1080p)
- **Aspect Ratio:** Standard (16:9), vertical (9:16), square (1:1)
- **Frame Rate:** Typically 24-30fps
- **Length:** Plan for multiple short clips that can be combined
- **Output Format:** MP4, GIF, etc.

---

## 2. Reference Collection

### A. Visual References

Gather references to clarify your vision:

- **Style References:** Find images/videos with the desired aesthetic
- **Subject References:** Collect images of similar subjects/characters
- **Motion References:** Find videos with similar movements
- **Mood Board:** Create a collection of inspiration images

### B. Technical References

Collect examples demonstrating technical aspects:

- **Lighting:** Examples of desired lighting style
- **Camera Work:** Videos showing similar camera movements

### C. Organize References

Create a structured system for your references:

- Use folders or a tool like Pinterest/Miro
- Group references by category (style, subject, motion)
- Note specific elements you like about each reference

---

## 3. Prompt Development

### A. Draft Initial Prompts

Create your first prompt drafts:

1. Start with a basic description of what you want to see
2. Add style references and technical specifications
3. Include camera movement and action descriptions
4. Note any specific details that are crucial

### B. Structure Your Prompts

Follow a consistent structure:

```
[Style] [Subject] [Action] [Setting] [Atmosphere] [Camera Movement] [Technical Specifications]
```

Example:
```
Cinematic 8K footage of a red fox running through a snowy forest at dawn, volumetric lighting through trees, slow-motion tracking shot, shallow depth of field, shot on RED camera
```

### C. Prompt Variations

Prepare multiple prompt variations:

- Create 3-5 variations with different emphasis or wording
- Try different levels of specificity
- Experiment with different reference combinations

---

## 4. Test Generations

### A. Initial Tests

Run small-scale tests to find what works:

- Generate short clips with each prompt variation
- Use lower resolution/quality settings for faster iteration
- Test on a single frame first if the platform allows
- Randomize seeds to see variety of results

### B. Systematic Testing

Create a methodical approach to testing:

| Test # | Prompt | Seed (if fixed) | Settings | Results | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | [Prompt 1] | [Seed] | [Settings] | [Link] | [Observations] |
| 2 | [Prompt 2] | [Seed] | [Settings] | [Link] | [Observations] |
| 3 | [Prompt 1 + Modification] | [Seed] | [Settings] | [Link] | [Observations] |

### C. Evaluation

Assess your test results objectively:

- **Prompt Alignment:** Does it match what you described?
- **Quality:** Is the visual quality acceptable?
- **Temporal Consistency:** Does it maintain consistency over time?
- **Subject Clarity:** Is the subject clear and well-formed?
- **Motion Quality:** Does the motion look natural and appropriate?

---

## 5. Refinement Loop

### A. Analyze Results

Study your test generations to identify patterns:

- Note what worked well in specific prompts
- Identify common issues or artifacts
- Look for unexpected but interesting results
- Compare against your original vision

### B. Prompt Refinement

Improve your prompts based on analysis:

- Add more detail in areas that need improvement
- Remove or modify elements that caused problems
- Add negative prompts to avoid specific issues
- Emphasize elements that worked well

### C. Setting Adjustments

Experiment with generation settings:

- **Guidance Scale/CFG Scale:** Adjust how closely it follows the prompt
- **Temperature/Randomness:** Control creativity vs. predictability
- **Seed:** Fix the seed if you found a good starting point
- **Steps:** Increase for higher quality (if applicable)

### D. Iterative Testing

Continue testing in an organized way:

- Make one change at a time to isolate effects
- Keep detailed notes about each change and result
- Save all tests with clear naming conventions
- Recognize when you're getting diminishing returns
