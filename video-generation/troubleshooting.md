# AI Video Generation Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses the most common issues encountered when creating AI-generated videos and provides practical solutions.

## Visual Quality Issues

### Low Resolution or Blurry Output

**Causes:**
- Low quality settings
- Vague prompt
- Platform limitations

**Solutions:**
- Add detail-enhancing terms to prompts: "8K", "detailed", "sharp focus", "high definition"
- Use maximum quality settings when generating final output
- Specify "photorealistic detail" or "hyperdetailed" in prompts
- Use upscaling tools in post-processing (Topaz Video AI, etc.)

**Example Improved Prompt:**
```
Hyper-detailed 8K cinematic shot of a mountain landscape with crystal clear details, tack-sharp focus, photorealistic quality
```

### Visual Artifacts and Distortions

**Causes:**
- Model limitations with complex scenes
- Conflicting prompt elements
- Challenging subjects (hands, faces, text)

**Solutions:**
- Simplify the scene - focus on fewer elements
- Add "no distortion", "no artifacts" to negative prompts
- Regenerate with different seeds
- Fix problem areas in post-processing
- Generate problematic elements separately and composite

## Temporal Consistency Problems

### Flickering and Changing Elements

**Causes:**
- Model struggles with frame-to-frame consistency
- Insufficient temporal guidance

**Solutions:**
- Add "consistent lighting, stable scene, no flickering" to prompts
- Use negative prompt: "flickering, inconsistent"
- Fix seed for more consistency
- Use frame interpolation in post-processing
- Generate shorter clips and carefully join them
- Try tools like Topaz Video AI for temporal consistency

### Subject Identity Changes

**Causes:**
- Lack of specific identity anchoring
- Complex character details

**Solutions:**
- Provide very specific subject descriptions
- Add "consistent appearance throughout" to prompts
- Use image reference/initialization when possible
- For characters, describe exact features that must remain consistent

**Example Consistency Prompt:**
```
A woman with consistent appearance throughout: medium-length blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing red dress, no change in facial features
```

### Unnatural Movement

**Causes:**
- Lack of motion specification
- Physics-defying descriptions

**Solutions:**
- Specify "natural, smooth movement"
- Include "following laws of physics" in prompts
- Describe motion pace: "slow", "gentle", "fluid"
- Reference real-world motion: "walking naturally"
- For smoother motion, try "in slow motion"

## Technical Limitations

### Short Clip Length

**Causes:**
- Model design limitations (most generate only 2-4 seconds)
- Computational constraints

**Solutions:**
- Plan for multiple clips that will be combined
- Use video extension features (Runway Gen-2)
- Create loops or seamless clips that can be repeated
- Generate overlapping segments for smooth transitions
- Learn frame interpolation for extending footage

### Limited Control

**Causes:**
- Black-box nature of generative models
- Limited control mechanisms

**Solutions:**
- Use image initialization when available
- Start with simpler scenes and concepts
- Generate elements separately and composite
- Use platforms with more control options (where available)
- Build scenes in layers rather than all at once

## Tool-Specific Issues

### Runway Gen-2

- **Length limitation:** Use video extend feature; chain multiple generations
- **Style consistency:** Use strong style references; maintain identical prompt structure
- **Subject control:** Try image initialization for more precise control

### Pika Labs

- **Character issues:** Use detailed character descriptions; reference specific styles
- **Motion control:** Use explicit motion terms; specify camera movement separately
- **Quality variation:** Try multiple seeds; use style references; be specific about quality

### Stable Video Diffusion

- **Setup issues:** Follow official documentation; check GPU requirements
- **Short clips:** Generate more frames; plan for combination of clips
- **Motion limitations:** Keep motion descriptions simple; start with subtle movements

## Post-Processing Solutions

### Combining Multiple Clips

- Use consistent prompts and seeds across generations
- Apply cross-dissolve transitions between clips (12-24 frames)
- Color grade all clips together for consistency
- Use motion-based transitions to hide seams
- Match lighting conditions in prompts

### Improving Output Quality

- Use higher bitrate in export settings
- Export in ProRes/DNxHR then compress final version
- Apply subtle sharpening and enhancement
- Consider AI-based video enhancement tools
- Use frame interpolation for smoother motion

## Quick Debugging Process

1. **Isolate issues:** Change only one element at a time
2. **Document results:** Keep notes of what works and what doesn't
3. **Progressive complexity:** Start simple, add complexity gradually
4. **Reference comparison:** Test against known successful examples
5. **Platform testing:** Try the same prompt on different platforms if available

## When to Try Alternative Approaches

Consider hybrid workflows (combining AI with traditional techniques) when:
- Precise control is needed for specific elements
- Text or UI elements are required
- Exact timing or choreography is critical
- Perfect consistency is required across long videos

## Community Resources

- Tool-specific Discord servers (Runway, Pika Labs)
- Reddit communities: r/StableDiffusion, r/MediaSynthesis
- YouTube tutorials on video generation workflows
- GitHub repositories for open-source tools
