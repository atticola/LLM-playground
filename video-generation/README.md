# Video Generation with AI: Comprehensive Guide

This section of the repository tracks all aspects of AI video generation projects, tools, prompts, and workflows. It serves as a centralized knowledge base and project documentation hub for video generation experiments and production work.

## Directory Structure

- [`/projects/`](./projects/) - Individual video generation project documentation
- [`/tools/`](./tools/) - Guides for specific video generation tools 
- [`/prompts/`](./prompts/) - Effective prompts for different video generation tasks
- [`/workflows/`](./workflows/) - End-to-end workflows for different types of videos
- [`/resources/`](./resources/) - Learning resources, tutorials, and reference materials

## Getting Started

1. For a complete overview of AI video generation fundamentals, read [video_generation_fundamentals.md](./video_generation_fundamentals.md)
2. Explore the [tools directory](./tools/) to learn about different video generation platforms
3. Check out [example projects](./projects/) to see complete documentation examples
4. Review [prompt techniques](./prompts/) to improve your video generation results
5. Study [workflows](./workflows/) for end-to-end production processes

## Purpose of This Section

This video generation section helps you:

1. **Document your projects**: Keep detailed records of each video project
2. **Track your progress**: See how your skills and outputs improve over time
3. **Build a prompt library**: Save effective prompts for reuse across projects
4. **Standardize workflows**: Develop repeatable processes for consistent results
5. **Compare tools**: Evaluate different platforms for specific use cases
6. **Share knowledge**: Create a reference for yourself and collaborators
