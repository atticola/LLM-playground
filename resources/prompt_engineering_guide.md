# Prompt Engineering Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Clear
- Provide detailed instructions
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Define the format you want for the response
- Specify the tone, style, and perspective desired

### 2. Context Matters
- Provide relevant context information
- Set constraints and limitations
- Specify the intended audience
- Include examples when possible

### 3. Incremental Refinement
- Start simple and iterate
- Use feedback to improve prompts
- Build upon successful prompts
- Document what works and what doesn't

## Common Techniques

### Role Prompting
Ask the LLM to assume a specific role to influence its response style and knowledge emphasis.

**Template:**
```
Act as a [specific role] and [task instruction].
```

**Example:**
```
Act as an experienced data scientist and explain how to handle imbalanced datasets.
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Guide the LLM to break down complex reasoning into step-by-step thinking.

**Template:**
```
[Question or task]

Think through this step by step:
1. First, consider...
2. Then, analyze...
3. Finally, conclude...
```

**Example:**
```
What would happen to Earth's orbit if the Sun's mass suddenly doubled?

Think through this step by step:
1. First, consider the gravitational relationship between the Sun and Earth
2. Then, analyze how changing the Sun's mass affects this relationship
3. Determine the new orbital parameters
4. Finally, conclude what would happen to Earth's orbit
```

### Few-Shot Learning
Provide examples of the task before asking the LLM to perform a similar task.

**Template:**
```
Here are some examples:

Input: [example input 1]
Output: [example output 1]

Input: [example input 2]
Output: [example output 2]

Input: [example input 3]
Output: [example output 3]

Now, given the input: [actual input]
Output:
```

### Persona-Based Prompting
Define characteristics for the LLM to embody in its responses.

**Template:**
```
Respond to my questions as if you were [persona description]. [Additional context about the persona's knowledge, values, or communication style].
```

**Example:**
```
Respond to my questions as if you were a physicist from the year 2100. You have knowledge of both current physics and theoretical advancements made over the next 80 years.
```

### Format Specification
Explicitly define the output format.

**Template:**
```
[Task instruction]

Format your response as:
- [Format element 1]
- [Format element 2]
- [Format element 3]
```

**Example:**
```
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of electric vehicles versus gasoline vehicles.

Format your response as:
- Introduction: Brief overview of both vehicle types
- Advantages of Electric Vehicles: Bullet points
- Disadvantages of Electric Vehicles: Bullet points
- Advantages of Gasoline Vehicles: Bullet points
- Disadvantages of Gasoline Vehicles: Bullet points
- Conclusion: Summary statement about the comparison
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Temperature Control
Understand how model temperature affects creativity vs. accuracy.

- **Low temperature (0.0-0.3):** More precise, deterministic, and fact-based responses
- **Medium temperature (0.4-0.7):** Balance between creativity and accuracy
- **High temperature (0.8-1.0):** More creative, diverse, and potentially unpredictable responses

### System Prompts vs. User Prompts
- **System prompts:** Set the overall behavior, character, and limitations
- **User prompts:** Contain the specific questions or instructions

### Self-Consistency Techniques
Ask the model to:
1. Generate multiple answers to the same question
2. Evaluate its own responses
3. Correct errors or improve upon initial responses

**Example:**
```
Solve this math problem: [problem]

Generate 3 different solutions approaching this problem in different ways.
Then, evaluate each solution for correctness and efficiency.
Finally, select the best approach and explain why it's superior.
```

### Prompt Chaining
Break complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts, using the output of each prompt as input to the next.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Model Hallucination
- Explicitly ask for sources or confidence levels
- Request that the model indicate when it's unsure
- Ask the model to focus only on well-established facts

### Prompt Length Limitations
- Prioritize the most important information
- Remove unnecessary context or examples
- Break complex prompts into a series of exchanges

### Biased or Undesirable Responses
- Explicitly request balanced perspectives
- Ask for pros and cons of different viewpoints
- Specify that you want evidence-based information

## Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness

### Key Metrics
- Accuracy of information
- Relevance to the original query
- Completeness of the response
- Consistency across multiple generations
- Usefulness for the intended purpose

### Iteration Process
1. Design initial prompt
2. Test with the LLM
3. Evaluate results against metrics
4. Identify areas for improvement
5. Modify prompt and repeat
