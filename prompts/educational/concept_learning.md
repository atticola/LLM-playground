# Educational Learning Prompts

## Concept Explanation

```
Explain [concept] in the simplest terms possible.
Then, progressively increase the complexity of the explanation for someone with:
1. No background knowledge
2. Basic understanding
3. Intermediate understanding
4. Advanced understanding
```

## Multi-Perspective Learning

```
Explain [concept/topic] from multiple perspectives:
1. Historical perspective: How has this evolved over time?
2. Practical perspective: How is this applied in real-world situations?
3. Critical perspective: What are the limitations or controversies?
4. Future perspective: How might this change or develop in the future?
```

## Analogy-Based Learning

```
Explain [complex concept] using 3 different analogies:
1. An analogy related to everyday objects
2. An analogy related to nature
3. An analogy related to human relationships or social dynamics

For each analogy, explain:
- How the analogy maps to the concept
- Where the analogy breaks down
```

## Socratic Learning

```
I want to learn about [topic]. Instead of directly explaining it, guide me through a series of questions that will help me discover the key insights myself.

Start with fundamental questions and progressively move to more complex ones. After each of my responses, provide feedback and a new question that builds on what I've learned.
```

## Comparative Learning

```
Compare and contrast [concept A] and [concept B] in terms of:
1. Basic definition and purpose
2. Key characteristics
3. Strengths and limitations
4. Common misconceptions
5. Real-world applications
6. When to use one versus the other
```

## Interdisciplinary Learning

```
Explain how [concept] connects to and is relevant in these different disciplines:
1. Mathematics
2. Science
3. Art/Literature
4. History
5. Economics/Business
6. Ethics/Philosophy
```

## Problem-Based Learning

```
Create a realistic problem or scenario that requires understanding of [concept] to solve.

Then:
1. Provide clues or hints that would guide a learner to the solution
2. Explain the underlying principles that the problem demonstrates
3. Show how solving this problem deepens understanding of the concept
4. Suggest variations of the problem for further practice
